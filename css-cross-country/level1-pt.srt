2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,290
You're watching CSS Cross
Country and this is level one,

3
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,280
Frost-Proof Fundamentals.

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,940
In level one, we'll be
discussing how to add CSS, our

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,680
basic selectors, the cascade
order, and the float property.

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,500
Now, if this is a bit review
for you, go ahead and skip

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,910
ahead to the challenges.

8
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,990
We're trying to make sure
everyone's on the same page

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,510
before moving to the more
advanced materials.

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,980
First, let's start with how
we can add CSS to our

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,970
application.

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,950
Now, the easiest way to do this
is via the inline style

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,130
attribute in our HTML, and it's
very easy to do, but it's

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,770
a maintenance nightmare.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,700
Second, is adding our styles
via the document head which

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,900
also works, but if we have
more than one page in our

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,540
document also a maintenance
nightmare.

18
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,820
So the main way to add your
styles is via including them

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,240
all in external style sheet and
having a link in the head

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,130
of every page of
your document.

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,770
This is how we're going to treat
all the styles in this

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,480
course so assume everything
is on its own

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,730
separate style sheet.

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,330
Moving on there are three basic
selectors we're going to

25
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,860
cover in CSS Cross Country and
these are the element, class,

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,670
and ID selectors.

27
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,910
There are a number of more
selectors to deal with but

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,850
we're not going to cover them
in depth in the course.

29
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,590
If you'd like to learn more,
visit link one below this

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,700
video to learn more about things
like the child and

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,140
sibling selectors.

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,300
So the first of these basic CSS
selectors is the element

33
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,800
selector and just to review,
that's directly mapping the

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,760
HTML tag to your CSS
declaration.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,090
We're also able to select items
via the class attribute

36
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,750
with a class selector.

37
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,560
Finally, the ID selector allows
us to select items via

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,780
their ID attribute.

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,700
We also have the ability to
combine more than one of these

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,900
selectors together to
create a compound

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,080
selector like this one.

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,280
So let's talk about
the cascade order.

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,620
In CSS there are two different
cascades to contend with, the

44
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,460
first being where the styles are
found in your application.

45
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,280
Now, in order of increasing
priority, styles found in the

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,700
external style sheet can
be overridden by

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,280
the same style set

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,320
in the document head, can be
overridden by the same style

49
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,870
set inlinen can be overridden
by items marked important.

50
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,160
We'll go into why important
is a bad idea later in the

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,290
course, but just know that
since we're including

52
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,630
everything as though it's an
external style sheet, we won't

53
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,400
have to contend with things
found in the head

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,840
or in inline styles.

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,820
So the second cascade we have
to contend with is where the

56
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,570
property is actually declared
in our style sheet.

57
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,830
In this case, we have two intro

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,270
declarations setting colors.

59
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,380
Via the cascade, the second
color set will be the one that

60
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,350
is applied to the element.

61
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,440
It's important to remember
that these properties are

62
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,430
additive if they
don't conflict.

63
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,680
When things are shown to the
user, everything is going to

64
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,970
combine together, so if we have
more than one declaration

65
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,760
setting different properties
these will add

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,710
together later on.

67
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,800
So to round off level
one, let's talk

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,930
about the float property.

69
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,500
Now, you've probably used the
float property at some point

70
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,150
and seen something like this.

71
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,730
In this case, we're going to go
ahead and float our image

72
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,400
to the left, and that's going
to have the rest of the

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,710
content wrap around
that image.

74
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,600
But what is this
actually doing?

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,790
Now, when we float something
it's going to take that object

76
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,110
out of normal document flow and
push it to the specified

77
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,950
edge of its parent container.

78
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,160
Any other sibling content in
that container is going to

79
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,370
wrap around our floated item.

80
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,160
Now, the float property allows
us to define whether that item

81
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,820
should be on the left or right
or, if we want to remove a

82
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,790
float, we can declare none.

83
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,490
Floated items are going to stack
up against one another

84
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,570
until they reach a parent edge
at which point, they'll break

85
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,779
down to the next
available edge.

86
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,610
So in this case, if we have
three containers floating up

87
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,750
against one another, but the
parent width becomes too small

88
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,900
to contain all three, the final
object is going to break

89
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,770
down to a new line.

90
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,210
You have to take care though
when you have multiple things

91
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,840
floating with different
heights.

92
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,890
In this case, since the first
items height is greater than

93
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,600
that of the other two elements,
when one of the

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,800
other elements breaks to new
line the first available edge

95
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,550
is up against that first
item rather than all

96
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,590
the way at the bottom.

97
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,970
It's also important to consider
that since we can

98
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,380
float things left and right at
the same time, the order in

99
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,720
which they appear in the HTML is
important to know which one

100
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,970
will break through new
line, if necessary.

101
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,040
In this case, we have two
images, one floating left and

102
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,300
one floating right, if the
parent container is too small

103
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,800
to contain both of them on the
same line since the sled image

104
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,600
appears second in our HTML it's
going to break down below

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,210
the ski image should any
collision happen.

106
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,680
When multiple items are floated
right and stacking up

107
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,000
against one another, these
items are going to

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,850
float right to left.

109
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,130
So the first item in your HTML
will be the one that's found

110
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,380
on the far right.

111
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,690
So that does it for level one.

112
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,930
If you haven't already, please
go ahead and download the

113
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,420
slides on the sidebar.

114
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,840
They're going to prove to be an
invaluable resource to help

115
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,570
you move through
the challenges.

116
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,250
Also, please use the hints
if you get stuck.

117
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,960
We don't want you to get
stuck on any one

118
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,610
problem for too long.

119
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,860
Good luck.
